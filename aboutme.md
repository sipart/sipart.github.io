Hi. My name is Simon Partridge. An ex wood machinist, was an aspiring product designer but now an IT professional; former Win2K MCSE, my path in IT started in 1997:

- Currently a [Juniper](http://www.juniper.net/uk/en/){:target="_blank"} Certified Service Provider Network Engineer
- Happy family man with a love of the [Derbyshire Peak district](https://www.visitpeakdistrict.com/){:target="_blank"}

Technology, family and the great outdoors!
What else do you need in your life?
