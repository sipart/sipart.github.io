* A couple of Google Gemini Canvas html code creations. Some tweaking needed but the heavy lifting and prototyping by Gemini Canvas made creation very easy. The first page I created was from this prompt "create a professional polished one page info-graphic using the data below" with some data I had complied: [EV Charging Summary](https://sipart.github.io/ev-april24_to_sept25.html){:target="_blank"}. Apart from the funny Frankenstein logos it did a great job - I used this [SVG Icon site](https://tabler.io/icons){:target="_blank"} to get some proper icons
* The second page created was this simple [Photo Gallery](https://sipart.github.io/photos){:target="_blank"} - this took a bit more work persuading Gemini to get the format right, but that is all very easy in reality
