Spring has sprung and summer on the way!

## Automation

* A worthy excerpt from the book ["Network Programmability and Automation: Skills for the Next-Generation Network Engineer"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1491931256/) worth remembering:
>**Automation #1 recommendation**
>
>We know that network automation offers speed and agility for deploying changes, but it does the same for retrieving data from network devices as fast as the business demands, or more practically, as fast as needed to dynamically troubleshoot a network issue.
>  
>Since the advent of server virtualization, server and virtualization administrators have had the ability to deploy new applications almost instantaneously. And the faster applications are deployed, the more questions are raised as to why it takes so long to configure network resources such as VLANs, routes, firewall (FW) policies load balancing polices, or all of the above, if deploying a new three-tier application.
> 
>It should be fairly obvious that by adopting network automation, the network engineering and operations teams can react faster to their IT counterparts for deploying applications, but more importantly, it helps the business be more agile. From an adoption perspective, it's critical to understand the existing, and often manual, workflows before attempting to adopt automation of any kind, no matter how good your intentions are for making the business more agile.
> 
>If you don't know what you want to automate, it'll complicate and prolong the process. **Our number one recommendation as you start your network automation journey is to always understand existing manual workflows, document them, and understand the impact they have to the business.** Then the process to deploy automation technology and tooling becomes much simpler.
